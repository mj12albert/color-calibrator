# Color Calibrator

This is a tool used to calibrate design system colors based on the [CIELAB color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) in order to achieve perceptually uniform color scales. Most complex logic is handled by [this algorithm](https://github.com/lyft/coloralgorithm) that originated at Lyft. UI is based on a thumbnail from [this blog post](https://stripe.com/blog/accessible-color-systems) by Stripe.
